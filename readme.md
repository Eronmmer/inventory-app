# Steps. PS: I wrote this for me not you ðŸ˜ˆ. Peruse at your own peril.

- Start server
- Create routes
- Begin with users(You wanna be able to create users before you begin anything yeah? So, start with registering a user first)
- Create auth(two routes. 1. Get logged in user 2. Log user in and get token)
- Create dummy endpoints for your other routes and test with postman
- To use express validator, do the following:

```js
const {check, validationResult} = require('express-validator/check')

// Then as a second parameter in brackets, add your check.
app.post('/user', [
  // username must be an email
  check('username').isEmail(),
  // password must be at least 5 char long
  check('password').isLength({min: 5})
], async (req, res, next) => {
  if(!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(422).json({errors: errors.array()})
  }

  const {username, password} = req.body
  try {
    const newUser = new User({
      username, password
    })
    await newUser.save()
    res.json({msg: "User successfully created"})
  } catch(err) {
    console.log(err)
    res.status(500).send("Server Error")
  }
})
```

- Test that a user can now be created and saved to the database.
- Now hash password(if necessary obviously) with bcrypt or some other package. First generate a salt then hash password like so:

```js
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10)

user.password = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt)
```

- Send a jsonwebtoken when user has been successfully created. This will be used to keep a user logged in and access protected routes. Tokens will also be sent when a user logs in.

- Go to auth and enable logging in and making it possible to do GET requests whenever a protected route is hit. Validate email or username and password, check if details sent match with what's in the database, then sign with jwt to receive a token.

- Now that you can get tokens on logging in and registering, create middlewares that will use will validate this tokens whenever a protected route is hit.
