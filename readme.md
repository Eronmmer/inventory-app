# This is the API for an app I wanna build with React.

> Please keep in mind that this project is a work in progress

## Features


- Authentication
- CRUD functionality on various routes(auth, users, allUsers, purchases, products, customers, suppliers, sales). I'll probably add more later
- Users can update their account info(yet to implement email verification but that would be later)

## Usage

- `npm install`

- Go to the `default.json` file in the `config` directory and edit your mongoURI and jwtSecret details. The latter might not be necessary. Then run `npm run dev`

This is basically an inventory app that business owners can use to keep detailed track of their activities and other stuff. The frontend app(which I'm lazy to start working on) will do a better job at helping you understand what the idea is. Stay tuned. 

Incase you manage to go through the code and find one or two things that can be corrected, do well to make a PR 

E go be ✌✌
