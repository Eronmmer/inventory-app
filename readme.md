# Steps

- Start server
- Create routes
- Begin with users(You wanna be able to create users before you begin anything yeah? So, start with registering a user first)
- Create auth(two routes. 1. Get logged in user 2. Log user in and get token)
- Create dummy endpoints for your other routes and test with postman
